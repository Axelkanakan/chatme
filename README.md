# ChatMe

Simple chat application that allows you to edit, delete and send messages to multiple contacts. 

## Journey

One concept that I keep coming back to is state management and how to do it efficiently in React. The state management favorite in the React Community is Redux which comes with a lot of useful High-order Functions and Middlewares hence the popularity, but in order to understand it on a ground level, I focused my attention on pure Redux and built a simple chat app from scratch. ChatMe features include editing messages, deleting messages and sending messages to multiple contacts. 

The most valuable lesson from this project was building my understanding around combineReducers. Instead of have a huge state object, I can focus on the chunks specific to a component and combineReducers brings it all together in the end. 

Key Lessons:

• Redux
• combineReducers
• node-packages(txtgen, faker, lodash)
